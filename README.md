# DONSpire
My first Product Engineering (BUS 379) project under Professor Johnathan Cromwell's instruction.

## Written Design Specifications
The Written Specifications report covers:
* primary objectives our team has adopted to design our plane
* selected values for each major component of the plane including reasoning behind each decision
    *  total wing area (cm^2)
    *  wingspan (cm)
    *  coefficient of lift (C_L)
    *  coefficient of drag (C_D)
    *  motor kV rating
    *  battery volts (Vo)
    *  battery capacity (mAh)
    *  propeller pitch x diameter (in.)
 *  various tradeoffs confronted when making the above decisions
 *  expected performance in each competition category: (1) *speed*, (2) *payload capacity*, (3) *endurance*, (4) *aerobatics*, (5) *stability*
